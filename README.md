# surfs up

## Background

Jupyter notebook file: we will continue to use Jupyter Notebook for our weather analysis. The name of the file is climate_analysis.ipynb. This file will have all of the structure to help you get started on your analysis. Let's get started by downloading the notebook.

SQLite database: W. Avy has stored the weather data in a SQLite database. All SQLite databases are flat files, which means that they don't have relationships that connect the data to anything else. As a result, flat files can be stored locally, which will help us move more quickly through the analysis.

W. Avy is concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.

You know that you can set W. Avy's mind at ease by analyzing precipitation levels and showing him the cold, hard, data that backs up Oahu as the perfect place to surf. You have the last 12 months of precipitation data already loaded into your SQLite database, so you are ready to go.

W. Avy supplied you with the data he wants us to use and has asked you to look at a full year of data. When deciding how to parse the data, you remember that his favorite day is August 23, 2017 because it's the anniversary of the first time he ever went surfing and had ice cream on the same day. So, you decide to start the analysis there.

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
After executing the code and checking the results, a few folks are are appearing twice. Maybe they moved departments?

## Analysis And Challenges

## Methodology: Analytics Paradigm

#### 1. Decomposing the Ask


#### 2. Identify the Datasource
* employees.csv


#### 3. Define Strategy & Metrics
**Resource:** Postgres 14, pgAdmin, SQL

1. create ERD based on the 6 csv data above
1.

#### 4. Data Retrieval Plan
Import csv data into the database tables using pgAdmin import function.


#### 5. Assemble & Clean the Data


#### 6. Analyse for Trends

Results from data filter above will give us more in-depth information regarding the different departments, roles and future retirees.

#### 7. Acknowledging Limitations
pgAdmin is an old application for Postgres front end GUI. So sometimes when closing the application, the database will be corrupted and wiped out by pgAdmin. Do a full backup before closing.

#### 8. Making the Call:
The "Proper" Conclusion is indicated below on [Summary](#summary)

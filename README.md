Jupyter notebook file: we will continue to use Jupyter Notebook for our weather analysis. The name of the file is climate_analysis.ipynb. This file will have all of the structure to help you get started on your analysis. Let's get started by downloading the notebook.

SQLite database: W. Avy has stored the weather data in a SQLite database. All SQLite databases are flat files, which means that they don't have relationships that connect the data to anything else. As a result, flat files can be stored locally, which will help us move more quickly through the analysis.
